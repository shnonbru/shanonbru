### Art History and Digital Humanities  
Bridging the past and future, my work integrates Art History with the innovative methodologies of Digital Humanities. My research explores how technology transforms our understanding of art, culture, and society.  

#### **Current Projects**  
- [**Women of Lyon**](https://femmeslyon.hypotheses.org/femmes-de-lyon): A digital project shedding light on women's contributions to Lyon's cultural and historical landscape.  
- **Data, Weaving, and Code**: Investigating the interplay between materiality and digitality through textiles and computational analysis.  

#### **Research Interests**  
- **Cyberfeminism**: Examining how digital tools and spaces can amplify feminist narratives and foster inclusivity.  
- **Data Analysis in Social Sciences**: Leveraging data to uncover patterns, inform policies, and better understand societal dynamics.
- **Interlinked Data**: Enhancing interconnected knowledge through SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) and thesauri for better cultural and historical resource integration.

I am passionate about exploring interdisciplinary approaches, combining humanities with computational techniques to unlock new perspectives on historical and cultural phenomena.

=> OMEKA and Iconclass: Currently investigating these tools to enhance metadata structuring, resource organization, and iconographic analysis in digital projects.
